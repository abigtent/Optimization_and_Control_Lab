The objective of this lab is to utilize optimization techniques to control a system. The assignment
specifies that a study on a 3- DOF helicopter is to be conducted. Given a mathematical model of the
system, the goal is to study control behavior with different controllers. First we implement optimal
control of pitch and travel, both with and without feedback. This was achieved by minimizing a
quadratic optimization problem. The feedback was applied using a linear quadratic controller. In the
last part of the assignment optimal control of pitch, travel and elevation with feedback was performed.
A nonlinear inequality constraint was applied on the elevation during this task. MATLAB was utilized
to calculate the optimal control parameters and SIMULINK was used to control the helicopter
